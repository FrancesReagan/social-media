_Reflections_

IP address whitelisting in production is important as "whitelisting" creates a firewall-like barrier that only allows trusted sources to connect to my database.
Also, whitelisting reduces or limits potential entry points for hackers.  Whitelisting also is a standard compliance protocol --as many security standards and regulations
require network-level access controls. It also enables montioring/tracking/auditing who has access to my database.

The risks of allowing 0.0.0.0/0(anywhere)
